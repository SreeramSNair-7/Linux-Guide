  "long_description": "SystemRescue (formerly SystemRescueCD) is a specialized Linux distribution designed for system rescue, recovery, and administration tasks. Based on Arch Linux, it runs entirely from bootable media (USB/CD) without requiring installation. The distribution includes a comprehensive collection of system tools for partition management (GParted), data recovery (TestDisk, PhotoRec), disk cloning, filesystem repair, backup/restore operations, and network administration. SystemRescue supports a wide range of filesystems including ext2/3/4, XFS, Btrfs, NTFS, and FAT. It's an essential tool for system administrators, IT professionals, and anyone needing to rescue data or repair systems that won't boot. The distribution boots into a console environment by default but includes an XFCE desktop that can be started with the 'startx' command.",
