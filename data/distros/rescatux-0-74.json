  "long_description": "Rescatux is a Debian-based rescue Linux distribution that focuses on repairing unbootable systems and solving common computer problems. Unlike other rescue distributions that require command-line expertise, Rescatux provides user-friendly graphical wizards that guide users through repair operations. It can fix bootloader problems (GRUB, Windows bootloader), reset forgotten passwords (Windows and Linux), repair filesystems, restore the Master Boot Record, and recover deleted files and partitions. The distribution is particularly useful for users who need to repair systems but lack advanced technical knowledge. Rescatux includes the Super Grub2 Disk feature for advanced boot management. It's an essential tool for system administrators, IT support personnel, and home users dealing with boot failures or system corruption.",
