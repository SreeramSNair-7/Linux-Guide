  "long_description": "Endless OS is a unique Linux distribution built specifically for families, students, and educational institutions. It's based on Debian and uses OSTree technology for reliable system updates. The distribution ships with extensive offline content including encyclopedia articles (from Wikipedia), educational videos, games, and learning applications. This makes it ideal for areas with limited or no internet connectivity. Endless OS uses a GNOME-based desktop that's simplified and intuitive for beginners. Instead of traditional package managers, it exclusively uses Flatpak for application installation, ensuring app sandboxing and compatibility. The Hack Computer feature teaches programming concepts interactively. Endless OS is particularly popular in developing countries and educational settings where it provides a complete learning environment out of the box.",
