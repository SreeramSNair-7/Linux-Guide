  "long_description": "Slax is a Debian-based Linux distribution designed to be portable, fast, and modular. It's small enough to fit in your pocket (under 300 MB) and can run from a USB drive. Slax uses a modular system where applications can be added or removed as modules. The distribution boots quickly into a Fluxbox desktop by default, though KDE Plasma is also available. Slax allows persistent storage on USB, so changes are saved across reboots. It's ideal for system administration, data recovery, or having a portable Linux system that you can carry anywhere. The distribution emphasizes speed and simplicity.",
