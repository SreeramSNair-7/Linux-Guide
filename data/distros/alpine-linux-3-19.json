  "long_description": "Alpine Linux is an independent, security-focused distribution that's extremely lightweight and efficient. It uses musl libc instead of glibc, and busybox for core utilities, resulting in a minimal footprint. Alpine has become the go-to choice for Docker containers and cloud deployments due to its small image size (typically under 5 MB for base images) and security-first approach with PaX and grsecurity patches. The distribution uses its own package manager called apk (Alpine Package Keeper) which is fast and efficient. While it can run desktop environments, Alpine is primarily targeted at servers, containers, and embedded systems. The distribution follows a rolling release model with stable branches.",
