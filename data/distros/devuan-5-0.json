  "long_description": "Devuan GNU+Linux is a Debian fork created to provide users with init freedom - the ability to choose their init system without systemd. Born from the controversy surrounding Debian's adoption of systemd, Devuan maintains full Debian compatibility while offering traditional SysVinit as default, with OpenRC and runit as alternatives. The distribution aims to be simple, stable, and free from unnecessary complexity. Devuan is fully compatible with Debian packages that don't depend on systemd, giving users access to Debian's vast software repository. The project emphasizes user choice, transparency, and adherence to Unix philosophy. It's popular among system administrators and users who prefer traditional init systems or who have concerns about systemd's design. Devuan offers multiple desktop environments and can be used for both desktop and server deployments.",
