  "long_description": "Bodhi Linux is an Ubuntu-based distribution that stands out for its beautiful and highly customizable Moksha desktop environment. Moksha is a continuation of Enlightenment 17, providing an elegant yet lightweight interface. Bodhi follows a minimalist philosophy, installing only essential software and allowing users to add what they need. This approach keeps the system lightweight while maintaining a polished, modern appearance. The distribution is particularly suitable for older hardware while still looking great on modern systems. Bodhi includes its own theme manager and offers multiple desktop profiles (Standard, Laptop, Compositing) to suit different needs. Based on Ubuntu LTS releases, it benefits from Ubuntu's package ecosystem and long-term support.",
