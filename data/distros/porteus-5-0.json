  "long_description": "Porteus is a complete, portable Linux operating system optimized for running from removable media (USB drives, CDs, hard drives) or network boot. Based on Slackware, it's designed to be incredibly fast - typically booting in under 30 seconds - and runs entirely in RAM after boot, making it exceptionally responsive. Porteus uses a unique modular system where software is packaged as .xzm modules that can be activated or deactivated on the fly without rebooting. This makes software management extremely flexible. Users can choose between several desktop environments (KDE, XFCE, Openbox, MATE), each available as a separate edition. Porteus can run in 'Always Fresh' mode (no persistence), or save changes to a file/partition for persistence. The distribution includes the USM (Unified Slackware Package Manager) tool for easy software installation. It's ideal for system rescue, secure browsing, portable workstation, or running Linux on computers where you can't modify the hard drive.",
